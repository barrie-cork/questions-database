- ✅ Single embedding generation
- ✅ Batch embedding processing
- ✅ Large batch chunking (100 items per batch)
- ✅ Question enrichment for embedding
- ✅ Similarity calculation tests
- ✅ Rate limiting verification
- ✅ Error handling and retries
- ✅ Dimension validation (768 dimensions)

### ✅ Phase 4: Integration Tests (COMPLETED)
- ✅ PDF Processor pipeline tests
- ✅ Database operations tests
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tests

### ✅ Phase 5: API Tests (COMPLETED)
- ✅ FastAPI endpoint tests
- ✅ WebSocket connection tests
- ✅ File upload tests
- ✅ CRUD operations tests

### ⏳ Phase 6: E2E Tests (PENDING)
- ⏳ UI interaction tests with Playwright
- ⏳ Full workflow tests
- ⏳ Cross-browser testing

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Async Testing Pattern**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation(self, service, mock_response):
    with patch.object(service.client, 'method') as mock:
        async def async_return(*args, **kwargs):
            return mock_response
        mock.return_value = async_return()
        result = await service.async_method()
```

### 2. **Mocking External APIs**
- Comprehensive mocking of Mistral OCR API
- Gemini LLM and Embedding API mocks
- Proper async mock handling

### 3. **Fixture Organization**
- Service fixtures for easy instantiation
- Mock response fixtures for reusability
- Sample data fixtures for consistency

### 4. **Error Testing**
- Retry mechanism verification
- Rate limiting testing
- Exception handling validation

## Docker Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec app pytest

# Run specific test file
docker-compose exec app pytest tests/test_ocr_service.py -v

# Run with coverage
docker-compose exec app pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests
docker-compose exec app pytest -m unit

# Watch mode (if needed)
docker-compose exec app pytest-watch
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **SQLite for Test Database**
Using in-memory SQLite with aiosqlite for fast, isolated test database operations.

### 2. **Comprehensive Mocking**
All external API calls are mocked to ensure tests are:
- Fast and reliable
- Not dependent on external services
- Not consuming API quotas

### 3. **Async Testing Throughout**
Using pytest-asyncio with proper async/await patterns for all async operations.

### 4. **Docker-Based Testing**
All tests run in Docker containers ensuring:
- Consistent environment
- Proper dependency versions
- Easy CI/CD integration

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration Tests**
   - PDF processor pipeline with all services
   - Database transaction testing
   - Vector operations testing

2. **Implement API Tests**
   - All REST endpoints
   - WebSocket functionality
   - File upload handling

3. **Add E2E Tests**
   - Full user workflows
   - UI interaction testing
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Coverage Goals**
   - Target: 80%+ code coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Document uncovered edge cases

## Issues Resolved

1. **httpx Import Error**
   - Changed `httpx.TimeoutError` to `httpx.TimeoutException`
   - Applied fix across all services

2. **Database Schema Issues**
   - Made trigger creation idempotent with `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS`
   - Prevented initialization failures on restart

3. **Mistral API Changes**
   - Updated from chat completions to new OCR API
   - Used `client.ocr.process()` method
   - Verified with latest documentation via Context7

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Latest API Docs**: The Mistral API had significant changes that required test updates.
2. **Mock Async Properly**: Use proper async mock patterns for `run_in_executor` and similar patterns.
3. **Docker Simplifies Testing**: Having everything in containers makes testing much more reliable.
4. **Comprehensive Fixtures Save Time**: Well-designed fixtures in conftest.py make tests cleaner and more maintainable.
