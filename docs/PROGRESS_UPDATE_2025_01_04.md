# Progress Update - January 4, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on debugging and fixing the PDF Question Extractor application, including resolving critical issues with datetime serialization and form data handling.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. DateTime Serialization Errors
**Problem**: Multiple endpoints were failing with "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable" errors.

**Root Cause**: Exception handlers in `app.py` were using `.dict()` method which doesn't properly serialize datetime objects.

**Solution**: Updated all exception handlers to use `.model_dump(mode='json')` for proper datetime serialization:
```python
# Before
content=ErrorResponse(...).dict()

# After
content=ErrorResponse(...).model_dump(mode='json')
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/app.py` - Updated all exception handlers (lines 85, 99, 123)

### 2. Malformed Config Class
**Problem**: `ProcessingProgressResponse` schema had a malformed Config class where `json_encoders` was split across multiple lines incorrectly.

**Solution**: Fixed the Config class structure:
```python
class Config:
    json_encoders = {
        datetime: lambda v: v.isoformat()
    }
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/api/schemas/responses.py` - Fixed ProcessingProgressResponse Config class (lines 40-43)

### 3. Upload Endpoint Validation Error
**Problem**: Upload endpoint was expecting JSON body but frontend was sending multipart form data.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between endpoint parameter types and frontend implementation.

**Solution**: Changed upload endpoint to accept form data parameters:
```python
# Before
async def upload_files(
    upload_request: UploadRequest = Body(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...),
    ...
)

# After
async def upload_files(
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...),
    store_to_db: bool = Form(default=True),
    generate_embeddings: bool = Form(default=True),
    max_concurrent: int = Form(default=2),
    ...
)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/api/routes.py` - Updated upload endpoint parameters (lines 136-143)
- `/static/js/app.js` - Updated frontend to send form fields instead of JSON (lines 654-657)

### 4. LLM Service Async Method Error (Pending)
**Problem**: LLM service failing with "'Models' object has no attribute 'generate_content_async'"

**Status**: Identified but not yet fixed. The Google Gemini API client method name appears to be incorrect.

## Current Status

### Working Features
✅ Docker container builds successfully
✅ Web interface loads properly
✅ PDF upload accepts files
✅ OCR processing completes successfully
✅ File chunking works for large documents
✅ Frontend properly sends form data
✅ All datetime serialization issues resolved

### Pending Issues
❌ LLM service async method call needs correction
❌ Question extraction blocked by LLM error
❌ Full pipeline not yet operational

## Testing Performed

### E2E Test Setup
Created comprehensive Playwright E2E test suites:
- `/tests/e2e/test_user_workflows.py` - User workflow testing
- `/tests/e2e/test_critical_paths.py` - Critical path validation
- `/manual_pdf_upload_test.py` - Manual PDF upload testing

### Manual Testing Results
- Successfully uploaded "June 2022 QP.pdf"
- OCR extracted 798,406 characters
- Document chunked into 28 parts
- Processing halted at LLM service with async method error

## Next Steps

1. **Fix LLM Service**: Correct the async method call in `llm_service.py`
   - Investigate correct Google Gemini API async method name
   - Update method call from `generate_content_async` to correct name

2. **Complete Pipeline Testing**: Once LLM fix is applied:
   - Test full question extraction
   - Verify database storage
   - Test embedding generation
   - Validate search functionality

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor processing times for large PDFs
   - Optimize chunking strategy if needed
   - Review rate limiting implementation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Datetime Serialization**: Always use `.model_dump(mode='json')` for Pydantic models with datetime fields
2. **Form Data vs JSON**: Ensure frontend and backend agree on data format (multipart vs JSON)
3. **API Documentation**: Keep API client usage up-to-date with library changes
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages help identify issues quickly

## Docker Logs Summary

Key log entries showing progress:
```
2025-08-04 17:48:33 - PDF uploaded successfully
2025-08-04 17:49:16 - OCR completed (798,406 chars extracted)
2025-08-04 17:49:46 - Text chunked into 28 parts
2025-08-04 17:51:13 - LLM error: 'Models' object has no attribute 'generate_content_async'
```

## Recommendations

1. Update all similar datetime serialization patterns across the codebase
2. Add integration tests for the complete PDF processing pipeline
3. Implement better error recovery for external API failures
4. Consider adding retry logic for LLM service calls
5. Add monitoring for processing pipeline stages
