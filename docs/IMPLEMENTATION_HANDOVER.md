# PDF Question Extractor - Implementation Handover Document

## Project Status (Updated)

As of the current implementation, the following components have been completed:

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - `docker-compose.yml` configured with PostgreSQL (pgvector) and application containers
   - `Dockerfile` created with Python 3.11, all dependencies, and security best practices
   - Entrypoint script for automatic database initialization

2. **Database Configuration**
   - PostgreSQL schema with pgvector extension
   - Three tables: `extracted_questions`, `questions`, `question_embeddings`
   - Proper indexes for performance including HNSW for vector search
   - SQLAlchemy models with async support

3. **All Core Services Implemented**
   - ✅ Mistral OCR service with async/await support and robust error handling
   - ✅ Gemini LLM service with structured output and smart chunking
   - ✅ Gemini embedding service with batch processing
   - ✅ Shared utilities module with RateLimiter
   - ✅ Configuration management with environment variables

4. **Critical Issues Fixed**
   - ✅ Fixed async/sync blocking in OCR service using `run_in_executor`
   - ✅ Improved OCR response parsing with multiple fallbacks
   - ✅ Extracted shared RateLimiter to utils module
   - ✅ Added service configurations to config.py

### ⏳ Pending Components

1. **PDF Processor** (`services/pdf_processor.py`) - Next priority
2. **FastAPI Application** (`app.py`)
3. **API Routes** (`api/routes/`)
4. **Web UI** (`static/`)
5. **Tests** (`tests/`)

## Key Implementation Insights

### 1. Docker Development Environment

**Why Docker?**
- Ensures consistent PostgreSQL with pgvector across all developers
- Eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- Simplifies onboarding - just `docker-compose up`

**Important Notes:**
- The entrypoint script automatically initializes the database
- Database persists in Docker volume `postgres_data`
- Hot-reload enabled for development (code changes reflect immediately)

### 2. Database Design Decisions

**Two-Stage Storage:**
- `extracted_questions` table for temporary storage during review
- `questions` table for permanent approved questions
- This prevents bad data from entering the main database

**Vector Storage:**
- Separate `question_embeddings` table allows for versioning
- 768-dimension vectors (can be increased to 3072 if needed)
- HNSW index for fast similarity search

### 3. API Integration Patterns

**Mistral OCR:**
- Handles both file upload and URL-based processing
- Base64 encoding for file uploads
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Max file size: 50MB

**Gemini Integration:**
- Using new `google-genai` SDK (not the deprecated one)
- Structured output with Pydantic models ensures consistent JSON
- Smart chunking for documents >50k characters
- Rate limiting implemented to avoid API limits

### 4. Architecture Decisions

**Async Everything:**
- FastAPI with async/await throughout
- AsyncPG for database operations
- Aiofiles for file operations
- Better performance and scalability

**Service Layer Pattern:**
- Each external API has its own service class
- Services are independent and testable
- PDF Processor orchestrates all services

## Development Workflow

### Starting the Development Environment

1. **First Time Setup:**
```bash
# Copy environment file and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MISTRAL_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

2. **Database will auto-initialize** with schema on first run

3. **Access the application** at http://localhost:8000

### Adding New Features

1. **Always use async/await** for I/O operations
2. **Follow the existing patterns** in services/
3. **Add proper error handling** with try/except blocks
4. **Include logging** for debugging
5. **Write tests** for new functionality

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Make sure to rebuild the Docker image after adding dependencies:
```bash
docker-compose build app
```

### Issue: Database connection errors
**Solution:** Check that PostgreSQL container is healthy:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs postgres
```

### Issue: API rate limits
**Solution:** The rate limiter in `llm_service.py` handles this, but you may need to adjust the limits based on your API tier

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Complete the LLM Service:**
   - Save the `llm_service.py` file
   - Test with a sample PDF

2. **Implement Embedding Service:**
   - Follow the pattern in the PRD
   - Use same rate limiting approach as LLM service

3. **Create PDF Processor:**
   - Orchestrate OCR → LLM → Embedding pipeline
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Log progress for debugging

4. **Build FastAPI App:**
   - Start with health check endpoint
   - Add upload endpoint
   - Implement question CRUD operations

5. **Create Web UI:**
   - Use provided HTML/JS from PRD
   - Tabulator.js for the data grid
   - Keep it simple - no build process needed

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Test each service independently with mocked API calls
2. **Integration Tests:** Test the full pipeline with sample PDFs
3. **API Tests:** Use pytest with FastAPI test client
4. **Manual Testing:** Use the web UI to test the full workflow

## Important Configuration Notes

- **API Keys:** Must be set in `.env` file
- **PostgreSQL:** Default password is `securepassword123` - change in production!
- **File Uploads:** Limited to 50MB by Mistral OCR
- **Token Limits:** Gemini has 1M token context window

## Recommended Development Order

1. Finish core services (OCR, LLM, Embedding)
2. Create PDF processor to tie them together
3. Build minimal FastAPI app with upload endpoint
4. Test the pipeline end-to-end
5. Add the review UI
6. Implement approval/save functionality
7. Add tests and documentation

## Contact for Questions

If you encounter issues with the implementation, check:
1. Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
2. Python logs in the `logs/` directory
3. PostgreSQL logs in the postgres container

The architecture is designed to be straightforward and maintainable. Follow the patterns established in the completed components, and the rest should flow naturally.
