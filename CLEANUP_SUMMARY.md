# Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-08-04

### Actions Performed

#### 1. Reorganized Test Files
- Moved 3 test scripts from root `pdf_question_extractor/` to `pdf_question_extractor/tests/manual_tests/`:
  - `test_ocr_direct.py` - Manual OCR API testing
  - `test_ocr_metadata.py` - OCR metadata inspection
  - `test_setup.py` - Dependency verification
- Created `tests/manual_tests/README.md` to document these manual test scripts

#### 2. Fixed Configuration Inconsistencies
- Updated `.env.example` to remove Flask-specific configuration:
  - Changed `FLASK_ENV` → `APP_ENV`
  - Changed `FLASK_DEBUG` → `DEBUG`
  - Updated comment from "Flask Configuration" to "Application Configuration"
- Note: The actual `.env` file still contains Flask variables - user should update manually

#### 3. Removed Unused Imports
- Cleaned `app.py` by removing unused imports:
  - Removed `os` import (not used)
  - Removed `Dict, Any` from typing (not used)
- Other service files were checked but had no unused imports

#### 4. Updated Documentation
- Fixed WebSocket references in main README.md:
  - Changed "WebSocket Support" to "Progress Tracking" in architecture diagram
  - Changed "Real-time progress via WebSocket" to "Real-time progress tracking"

#### 5. Cleaned Build Artifacts
- Removed 6 `__pycache__` directories throughout the project

### Recommendations for Further Cleanup

1. **Update .env file**: Remove Flask configuration variables and use the new APP_ENV, DEBUG format
2. **Consider consolidating documentation**: Some overlap between different README files
3. **Review test coverage**: Ensure all manual test scripts have automated equivalents where possible
4. **Database migrations**: Consider implementing Alembic for proper database version control

### Project Structure Improvements
- Test files are now properly organized in the tests directory
- Configuration is more consistent with FastAPI usage
- Documentation accurately reflects the current implementation

### Documentation Consolidation (Phase 2)

#### 6. Consolidated Overlapping Documentation
- Updated `pdf_question_extractor/README.md` to be a concise component guide
- Removed `pdf_question_extractor/API_SETUP.md` after merging unique content into `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- Enhanced `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` with WebSocket testing examples and SQL queries
- Updated all cross-references in documentation files
- Removed duplicate content from main README.md

### No Breaking Changes
All cleanup actions were non-destructive and maintain backward compatibility. Documentation is now better organized with single sources of truth for each topic.
